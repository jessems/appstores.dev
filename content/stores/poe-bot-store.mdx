## Overview

Poe (Platform for Open Exploration) is Quora's AI platform launched in 2022 that positions itself as the "app store of conversational AI." It aggregates multiple AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and others, while hosting a marketplace of user-created bots.

## Bot Types

### Prompt Bots (No-Code)
- Created using natural language instructions
- Poe prepends your instructions to every user message
- No programming required
- Perfect for specialized assistants, tutors, and creative bots

### Server Bots (Code-Based)
- Configure webhook endpoints for custom backend logic
- Full control over bot behavior and data fetching
- Connect to external APIs and databases
- Requires hosting infrastructure

## Monetization Options

### Subscription Revenue Share
When your bot encourages a user to subscribe to Poe Premium, you receive a share of the subscription revenue.

### Price-Per-Message
Introduced in April 2024, creators can set a specific price in compute points for each message sent to their bot. This is essential for bots with significant API costs.
