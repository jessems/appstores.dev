## Overview

The Claude MCP Marketplace encompasses the ecosystem of Model Context Protocol servers and plugins that extend Claude's capabilities. MCP is an open protocol introduced by Anthropic that standardizes how LLMs communicate with external tools, databases, and services.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?
MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to:
- Access external data sources
- Execute actions on third-party services
- Maintain persistent state
- Interact with local and remote tools

### Protocol Benefits
- **Standardization**: One protocol for all integrations
- **Security**: Controlled access to external resources
- **Flexibility**: Works across different AI platforms
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities

## MCP Server Categories

### Official (Anthropic)
- File system access
- Git operations
- Database connections
- Web browsing

### Search & Web
- Web scraping tools
- Search engine integrations
- API connectors

### Communication
- Slack integrations
- Email access
- Messaging platforms

### Productivity
- Calendar access
- Task management
- Document handling

### Development
- Code analysis
- Testing tools
- Deployment automation

### Database
- PostgreSQL, MySQL connections
- Vector databases
- Data warehouses

## Claude Artifacts Integration

Artifacts can now connect to MCP:
- Interactive applications with external service access
- Read/write to tools like Asana, Google Calendar, Slack
- Persistent storage across sessions
- Personal or shared storage options

## MCP Registries & Directories

### Official Registry
- registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- Authoritative metadata repository
- Currently in preview

### Community Directories
- **MCP.so**: Largest collection
- **mcpservers.org**: Curated directory
- **mcpmarket.com**: Discovery marketplace
- **Cline MCP Marketplace**: One-click installs

## Claude Code Plugins

Claude Code 2.0.13 introduced plugin marketplace:
- Package slash commands
- Bundle specialized agents
- Include MCP servers
- Single-command installation

### Official Plugin Repository
- github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official
- Curated high-quality plugins
- Anthropic-vetted for trust

## Building MCP Servers

### TypeScript SDK
```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server";

const server = new Server({
  name: "my-mcp-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
});

// Define tools and resources
```

### Python SDK
```python
from mcp import Server

server = Server("my-mcp-server")

# Define tools and resources
```

## Security Considerations

- Trust plugins before installing
- MCP servers run with elevated permissions
- Anthropic does not control third-party servers
- Review source code when possible
- Use official/verified sources
