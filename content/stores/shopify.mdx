## Overview

Shopify App Store is the leading e-commerce app marketplace, serving millions of merchants with over 10,000 apps. In 2025, Shopify changed their revenue share policy from annual to lifetime thresholds.

## 2025 Revenue Share Changes

**Important:** As of 2025, the $1M commission-free threshold is now **lifetime**, not annual:
- First $1M lifetime revenue: 0% commission
- After $1M lifetime: 15% (or 20% without $19 registration)
- All transactions: 2.9% processing fee

### Impact
- Small developers (<$1M total): No change
- Larger developers: Pay commission on full revenue after exceeding lifetime threshold

## App Billing API

Shopify handles billing through their API:
- Recurring charges (subscriptions)
- One-time charges
- Usage-based charges
- Automatic merchant invoicing
