## Overview

Chrome Web Store distributes extensions, themes, and progressive web apps for Google Chrome. With Chrome's dominant browser market share, it's essential for reaching web extension users.

## Manifest V3

Google now requires Manifest V3 for all new extensions, which:
- Limits background script capabilities
- Restricts certain APIs
- Enhances user privacy
- Changes how content blocking works
