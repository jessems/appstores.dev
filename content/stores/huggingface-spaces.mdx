## Model Hub Integration

Spaces connect directly to Hugging Face Hub:
- 400,000+ pre-trained models
- 100,000+ datasets
- One-line model loading
- Automatic caching

## Building a Space

1. Create Space (Gradio, Streamlit, or Docker)
2. Write your application code
3. Define requirements.txt
4. Push to Hugging Face
5. Space builds and deploys automatically

### Example Gradio Space
```python
import gradio as gr

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}!"

demo = gr.Interface(fn=greet, inputs="text", outputs="text")
demo.launch()
```
